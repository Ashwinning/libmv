#summary Description of libmv's SURF implementation.

 * From the paper, there are overlapping filters performed at different octaves; by having a translation table it is possible to avoid recomputing some levels in the pyramid.

== Code location ==

 * image/blob_response.h - Hessian response (interest point detection).
 * image/integral_image.h - The summed-area-table.
 * image/non_maximal_suppression.h - Find local maxima in an Array3Df.

==== Stuff that's not finished ====

 * image/surf.h - Overall algorithm; calls other pieces. Does interest point detection at different scales but doesn't calculate descriptors.
 * image/surf_description.h - (not started) Calculate a surf description given an image, scale, and location.
 * image/kdtree.h - (not started) N-dimensional matching. May switch to LSH, depending.
