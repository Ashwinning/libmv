#summary What Julien is been working on in libmv.

= General =
*Tracker*
  * ~~remove the useless template TImage.~~ -We will define a pyramid image tracker class.-
  * replace the matcher pointer by an Enum.
  * find a way to make the tracker class to be the owner of the detector/describer classes, keeping in mind that the user should be able to choose its detector/describer (+parameters) : _use template/functors ?_
  * ~~find a solution to the Featureset delete issue:~~ _a structure/class with the matches and a vector/list of Features ?_
  * Only match the new featureSet with one of the descriptor (and not all) of known features : a feature has approximately the same descriptor in every images
  * ~~make a robust Traker (epipolar filtering)~~ _see nvr, as a new  function/class ?_
  * make a robust Traker for planar scene (homography filtering) _see nvr, a PlanarTracker class ?_
  * extend the Tracker to handle pyramid images (intra/inter-level features matching)

*Masks*
  * add a mask system so that we can associate a mask to an image. Every feature detectors should then only detect features in the visible zone.
  * add a mask system ? in the matching process in order to handle predicted features (ellipsoid, rectangle, ...)

*Overview*
  * Camera Tracking
    * 2D Tracking
      * Windowed tracker NxM px mask
      * Local tracking (only track in the N last views)
    * Robust pose estimation(resection)
      * Linear pose estimation (3 or 5 points) + RANSAC (detect & remove outliers)
      * Non-linear pose refinement 
    * Keyframe detection
      * Enough correspondences in the N last views, enough inliers, ...
  * Mapping (only for keyframes)
    * Triangulation (intersection)
      * Linear 3D points triangulation of inliers
    * Refinement
      * global/local Bundle Adjustment
