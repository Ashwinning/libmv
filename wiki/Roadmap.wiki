#summary Release plans, goals and features list for libmv.

Content
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />
== Introduction ==
We're going to release libmv and need to know which features are needed for which release.

The basic idea is to have something like this:

* Libmv 0.x:*
  * Initial match moving algorithms with known camera intrinsics
  * Unstable API 

* Libmv 1.0:*
  * *Targeted application*: Matchmoving
  * Efficient match moving with known camera intrinsics
  * Stable API + Complete Unit tests

* Libmv 2.0:*
  * *Targeted application*: Unordered image reconstruction (ala Bundler)
  * Reconstruction from an unordered image set
  * Generic Bundle Adjustment library (ala SBA/SSBA [BundleAdjustment])
  * Match moving with unknown camera intrinsics?
  * Libmv 2.0: Stable API + Complete Unit tests

* Libmv 3.0:*
  * *Targeted application*:  Dense 3D reconstruction (+clustering?) (ala PMVS/CMVS)
  * Dense 3D reconstruction
  * Image clustering (ala cmvs)?

The *next major release will be 1.0* and *packages will be made*. 

Before this release, we will produce several unstable versions (0.Y), where Y will be increased each time that a feature (defined in the following tables) reach the DONE state.
