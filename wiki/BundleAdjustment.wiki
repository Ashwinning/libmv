= Introduction =

This page describes our needs for the nonlinear least square (SfM dedicated) library.

We need to have our own sparse BA and even more: we need a custom optimization lib, including a BA.
We can build it on the top of Eigen3'snonlinear and sparse modules (not yet stables, but working?)!

= Functionalities needed =
  * optimize the cameras parameters only (pose optimization: one camera or several, intrinsics and/or extrinsics with/without distortions, maybe using different parametrization of angles etc.)
  * optimize structure parameters: we currently use 3D points but one day we will handle lines for instance
  * a BA with numerical and analytical derivatives
  * a sparse BA since we need to be able to optimize thousand of cameras!
  * a BA that can easily accept constraints for stereo vision, partly fixed scene, etc.
  * we can even think about an extension to generic camera too (catadioptric, fisheye, etc.). Instead of minimizing the reprojection error we may support rays.
  * ...

= Implementation details =

== How to do ==
  * Where: in _src/libmv/optimization_
  * Dependencies: no. (will be called in camera/multiview libs)
  * Parameters: vector only? matrices?

== Possibles signatures ==
  * Camera(s) only
    * {{{OptimizeCamera(Vec12 *cam)}}}?
    * {{{OptimizeCamera(Mat43 *cam)}}}?
    * ...
  * Structure(s) only
    * {{{OptimizeStructure(Vec *structure)}}}
    * ..
  * Cameras and Structures (Bundle Adjustment)
    * {{{BundleAdjust(...)}}}
    * ...
