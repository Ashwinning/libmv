= Introduction =

This page describes our needs for the nonlinear least square (SfM dedicated) library.

We need to have our own sparse BA and even more: we need a custom optimization lib, including a BA.
We can build it on the top of Eigen3'snonlinear and sparse modules (not yet stables, but working?)!

Where: in _src/optimization_?
Dependencies: no? camera/multiview?
Parameters: vector only? matrices? classes (camera/structure/...)?

= Functionalities needed =
  * Functionality one
  * Functionality two
  * ...

= Possibles signatures =
  * Camera(s) only
    * {{{OptimizeCamera(Mat43 *cam)}}}
    * ...
  * Structure(s) only
    * {{{OptimizeStructure(Vec *structure)}}}
    * ..
  * Cameras and Structures (Bundle Adjustment)
    * {{{BundleAdjust(...)}}}
    * ...
