#summary The fastest pathway from the start of the rewrite to a working tracker.

= Introduction =

There is an almost infinite amount of work that _could_ be on libmv. To keep focused on producing something useful, here is a plan to get to something that is _useful_, though perhaps not feature-complete, in the shortest time possible.

In rough order of dependence:

= Work plan =

== Basic matrix and vector functionality ==

  * Fixed size arrays. 0.5 day.
  * Variable sized arrays. 1 day.
  * Dot product, outer product. 1 hour, without BLAS. 1 day using BLAS (not necessary at first).
  * SVD - Use LAPACK. Not trivial. 1 day.

See MatrixLibrary for other details.

== Image class and loading ==

  * Simple image class built on a matrix. Supports images that own and don't own the underlying data. 1 day.
  * Load PNG images. 3 hours.
  * Load JPG images. 2 hours.

== Image processing and caching ==

  * Simple LRU cache for holding images. *DONE*.

== Correspondence Library ==
