= Introduction =

*CodeBlocks* (www.codeblocks.org/) is an IDE for cross-platform development with integrated editor, debugger and control of the gcc/g++ build process. This page describes how to setup a CodeBlocks project for LibMV development work.


= Details =

The procedure is fairly straightforward. It assumes you have the necessary development tools required to build LibMV (gcc, cmake, _etc._), and have CodeBlocks installed (I'm doing this with CodeBlocks 8.02 and cmake 2.6-patch 2, but this procedure likely works with other versions as well). Earlier versions of cmake may not have the CodeBlocks generator support.

*1)* Check out LibMV using SVN.

*2)* cd to the root directory for the LibMV codebase (the directory with the AUTHORS, README, _etc._ files, and most importantly the src/ subdirectory containing LibMV's source code).

*3)* Type 

cmake -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" src/

This should generate a file LIBMV.cbp which is a CodeBlocks project file.

*4)* Start CodeBlocks by either (i) typing "codeblocks LIBMV.cbp" from the directory of step 2, or run CodeBlocks, select File-Open and navigate to the directory with LIBMV.cbp and select it.

*5)* Select Build-Build (or click the gear icon on the toolbar), and (with a little luck) LibMV should build without any errors.
