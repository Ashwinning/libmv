== Introduction ==

[http://www.codeblocks.org/ CodeBlocks] is an IDE for cross-platform development with integrated editor, debugger and control of the gcc/g++ build process. This page describes how to setup a !CodeBlocks project for libmv development work.

== Details ==

The procedure is fairly straightforward. It assumes you have the necessary development tools required to build libmv (gcc, cmake, _etc._), and have !CodeBlocks installed (I'm doing this with !CodeBlocks 8.02 and cmake 2.6-patch 2, but this procedure likely works with other versions as well). Earlier versions of cmake may not have the !CodeBlocks generator support.

 # Check out libmv using SVN.
 # cd to the root directory for the libmv codebase (the directory with the AUTHORS, README, _etc._ files, and most importantly the src/ subdirectory containing libmv's source code).
 # Type `cmake -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" src/`. This should generate a file LIBMV.cbp which is a !CodeBlocks project file.
 # Start !CodeBlocks by either typing "codeblocks LIBMV.cbp" from the directory of step 2, or run !CodeBlocks, select File -> Open and navigate to the directory with LIBMV.cbp and select it.
 # Select Build -> Build (or click the gear icon on the toolbar), and (with a little luck) libmv should build without any errors.
