= Google Summer of Code 2011 (GSoC2011) =

We are going to apply for GSoC this year.

The main objective is to propose to one (or more) student(s) to integrate libmv into blender.

= Project objectives =
This projet will be an initial integration of libmv into Blender. 

Libmv has now many components dedicated or not to camera tracking. 
The main idea is to provide a basic camera tracking component into Blender using libmv. 
Note that we do not want to have all functionalities that other commercial software propose. 
But at the end of the project, anybody should be able to load a footage (images) in Blender and compute the camera trajectory using libmv.

The major objectives are
  * Load images in blender and send them to libmv
  * Call the libmv's 2D tracking process and retreive the 2D tracks
  * Display the 2D tracks on images
  * Allow the user to delete wrong tracks and add new ones
  * Call the libmv's camera tracking process
  * Display the estimated camera 3D trajectory

For more information on this integration see [libmvBlenderInterface] and [Blender2DTrackerPlan] (note that these pages will be updated with the new design of libmv, but they show the main idea).

*Important notes* 
Since libmv is still under development: 
  * the API will be modified/improved in order to fit with the project requirements. You will participate on both sides: libmv and blender.
  * the results of the camera tracking (and 2D tracking) will depend on the quality of our algorithms. An accurate camera trajectory estimation is *NOT* an objective of this projet (but is an objective of libmv ;) )

= Who we are looking for =
We are looking for students who
  * have a background in match moving (camera tracking) 
  * already know C++, python and Blender

  * Having an experience in developing Blender components is a big plus
  * Having an experience with one of the main existing commercial software (Boujou, PFTrack, MatchMover, etc.) is a plus.

= Applying for Libmv GSoC 2011  =
In order to apply to Libmv GSoC 2011, you should
  * Read the project description and make sure your background is appropriate
  * Apply to the [http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student/apply/google/gsoc2011 official Google SoC 2011]
  * Send us your application (to libmv-devel_AT_googlegroups.com) 

This application must contain the following information:
  * Name
  * Email address
  * Background (courses taken: UI, Computer programming, Match moving, etc)
  * Skills (c++, blender etc)
  * Experience (Work and open source)
  * A link to one of your code that you are proud of.
