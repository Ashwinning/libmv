#Tips to compile QT related libmv project on windows.

= Introduction =

Some project in libmv have a Graphical interface (TVR, Nview).
This Graphical Interface use the QT library from Nokia (http://qt.nokia.com/).


= Details =

First you have to download the QT libraries and source code for your compiler.

visual studio 2008 => http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008

If you use another compiler you have to download the source and compile QT by yourself : http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp

Once QT is installed on your machine at the location QTPATH => example C:/lib/QT

You could configure the CMake build system to use QT.

 # Edit the libmv/src/CMakeList.txt and comment NOT WIN32 things like the following :
  {{{
  #IF (NOT WIN32)
    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(ui)
  #ENDIF (NOT WIN32)
   }}}
 # In the CMakeGui interface edit the variable path QT_QMAKE_EXCUTABLE with yours :
  C:/lib/QT/bin/qmake.exe
 # Run Configure, Generate.
 # Compile your visual project file. (named tvr, nview)

That's all.
