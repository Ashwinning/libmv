#summary What Keir's been working on in libmv.

When I have time to spend on libmv, I plan out what I want to accomplish here and check things off as I go.

==== Sunday, June 29th, 2008 ====

  * ~~Expand components page, by looking at libmv1.~~
  * ~~Based on the components, figure out a reasonable directory hierarchy.~~
  * ~~Update current code and build to follow the new structure~~
  * ~~Make third_party directory, and check FLENS into it.~~
  * ~~Write ThirdPartyCode wiki page~~
  * ~~Make FLENS build inside libmv~~
  * ~~Figure out where to put FLENS-libmv tests~~
    * We will write unit tests for new functionality we add to flens, but inside the libmv unit test system. This is because FLENS unfortunately doesn't have a unit test system.
    * *Put them in the numeric/ directory.*
  * ~~Add copying between TinyMatrices and dense matrices to FLENS (I'll sync it upstream later).~~
  * Add comma list initializers to TinyMatrix / TinyVector.
  * Add numerics directory, and write nullspace() function and tests.
  * Create structure-from-motion directory and add nview triangulation and tests.
  * Put MIT license boilerplate on existing code.
  * Write page about tracking, summarizing the notes I made at ICVS2008

==== Saturday, June 28th, 2008 ====

  * Wrote simple tiny and dynamic matrix/vector library (with tests!).
  * Realized FLENS is better, so just use that.
  * Wrote several wiki pages (WorkPlan, MajorComponents, MinimizationLibrary, etc)
  * Switched to MIT license.

==== Even older stuff ====
