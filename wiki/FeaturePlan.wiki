#summary Must to have features and idea/todo list
== Introduction ==
We're going to release libmv and need to know which features are needed for which release.

The next release will be the 0.1 (since I think the amount of work done since the 0.0.2 is huge) and packages will be made.

 * TODO: not yet implemented
 * STARTED: an initial implementation has been started (in the SVN or not)
 * DRAFT: a first version of the feature is in the SVN (and may contains bugs)
 * GOOD: an advanced version of the feature is in the SVN (with unit test)
 * DONE: the feature is done and has no bug (with hope)
