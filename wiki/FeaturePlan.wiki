#summary Must to have features and idea/todo list
== Introduction ==
We're going to release libmv and need to know which features are needed for which release.

The basic idea is to have something like this:

* Libmv v0.Y:*
  * Initial match moving algorithms with known camera  intrinsics
  * Unstable API 

* Libmv v1.0:*
  * Efficient match moving with known camera  intrinsics
  * Stable API 
  * Blender interface?
  * "Complete" Unit tests

* Libmv v2.0:*
  * Match moving with unknown camera intrinsics
  * Generic Bundle Adjustment library (SSBA doesn't handle projective BA)

* Libmv vX.0* (X>2):
  * Miscellaneous things (images set reconstruction, AR, SLAM, etc.)
  * Add here your great computer vision application!


The *next major release will be 1.0* and *packages will be made*. 

Before this release, we will produce several unstable versions (0.Y), where Y will be increased each time that a feature (defined in the following tables) reach the DONE state.
