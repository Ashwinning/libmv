= Introduction =

*libmv* is a structure from motion library, which plans to one day take raw video footage or photographs, and produce full camera calibration information and dense 3D models.

*libmv* is cut in different moduleq (image/detector/descriptor/multiview) that allow to resolve part of the SFM process. Each module purpose documented functional implementation that rely on an Interface. The user could choose to use the available implementation or to customize the module by writing is own by using the same general interface.

*libmv* has also several applications and tools [ApplicationsAndTools]

= Image =
 * Image container (1->3 channel, various bit depth),
 * Image convert (RGB to Gray),
 * Image Drawing (Line, Circle, Rotated Ellipse),
 * Image Sequence,
 * Image Pyramid.

 * Image IO
  * JPG, PNM, PGM, PNG.

= Detector =
 * Corner detector (FAST),
 * SURF/ STAR,
 * MSER.

= Descriptor =
 * Sparse patch (Simplest),
 * SURF,
 * DAISY,
 * DIPOLE (WIP).

= Camera =
  * Pinhole camera
  * Lens: radial and tangential correction

= Multiview =

 * 2D and 3D Rigid geometric constraint (linear & robust (2D only) estimation)
  * Euclidean,
  * Similarity,
  * Affine,
  * Homography,

 * 2View Tensor
  * Fundamental matrix 7 Points,
  * Fundamental matrix 8 points.
  * Essential Matrix

 * NView Tensor
  * 6Pt - NView.

 * Robust estimation
  * Ransac.

 * Camera pose 
  * 5Pt solver,
  * 8Pt solver,
  * Projective resection,
  * Euclidean resection 
   * Ansar and Daniilidis method,

 * Triangulation
  * 2 View triangulation (projective)
  * N View triangulation (projective)
   * Geometric method

= Correspondence =
 * ArrayMatcher (Nearest Neighbor search)
  * Brute Force,
  * KDTREE (2 implementations : libmv, flann)

 * FindCandidateMatch
  * Symmetric nearest neighbour,
  * Lowe Ratio.

 * Matches
  * Allow to maintain tracks between images features.

 * Tracker.

= Tools =
 * Reading JPEG EXIF meta data.
