#summary Explain the main objective of each libmv module.

= Introduction =

*libmv* is a structure from motion library, which plans to one day take raw video footage or photographs, and produce full camera calibration information and dense 3D models.

*libmv* is cut in different module (image/detector/descriptor/multiview) that allow to resolve part of the SFM process. Each module purpose documented functional implementation that rely on an Interface. The user could choose to use the available implementation or to customize the module by writing is own by using the same general interface.

= image =
 * Image container (1->3 channel, various bit depth),
 * Image convert (RGB to Gray),
 * Image Drawing (Line, Circle, Rotated Ellipse),
 * Image Sequence,
 * Image Pyramid.

 * Image IO
  * JPG, PNM, PGM, PNG.

= detector =
 * Corner detector (FAST),
 * SURF/ STAR,
 * MSER.

= descriptor =
 * Sparse patch (Simplest),
 * SURF,
 * DAISY,
 * DIPOLE (WIP).

= multiview =

 * Rigid geometric constraint 
  * Affine,
  * Homography,
  * 2 points homography (related to Panoramic stitching, fixed center, rotated camera).

 * 2View Tensor
  * Fundamental matrix 7 Points,
  * Fundamental matrix 8 points.

 * NView Tensor
  * SixPointNView.

 * Robust estimation
  * Ransac.

 * Camera pose 
  * 5Pt solver,
  * Resection.

 * Triangulation.

= correspondence =
 * ArrayMatcher (Nearest Neighbor search)
  * Brute Force,
  * KDTREE (2 implementations : libmv, flann)

 * FindCandidateMatch
  * Symmetric nearest neighbour,
  * Lowe Ratio.

 * Matches
  * Allow to maintain tracks between images features.

 * NViewMatching
  * Robust filtered matches between N Images.

 * Tracker.

= tools =
 * Reading JPEG EXIF meta data.
