#summary What Pierre is been working on in libmv.

= Currently working on =

- Minimal solution for panoramic stitching : 
http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/minimal/minimal.html

- Make TVR crash proof (avoid crash when we click on a menu not in the good order).

- Write a Fast Corner Detector (Edward Rosten) Wrapper for Libmv.

- Integrate Daisy descriptor (A Fast Local Descriptor for Dense Matching).

= Task State =
* ~~Done~~

* Todo/Comment

== Minimal solution for panoramic stitching ==

 * ~~understand the 2 point algorithm and code/test it~~
  * An error have been found in a calculus detail of the paper.
 * Todo :
  * Understand and code the 3 point solution. (not an obligation).
  * Write down the robust estimation.

== Feature extraction ==

 * Write down the Fast Corner Detector wrapper for libmv
  * Add basic rotation invariant estimation.
  * Use basic sampling grid for the descriptor (8*8 sparse sampling).
  * If times use the HIPS descriptor http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~sjt59/hips.html

== Interface ==

 * design a basic interface that can an equivalent of TVR for multiview purpose.
  * Must support from 2 to N views.
  * Make a Panoramic or SFM (structure from motion) mode.

== Design ==
 * Write down a generic feature localization/extraction feature.
