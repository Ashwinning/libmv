Project: Sparse Bundle Adjustmet (SBA)

License: GPL
Upstream version: 1.5
Local modifications:

Small change to eucsbademo.c to have a function

  int MAIN__(void) {}

which is needed to work around a problem in f2c on older debian and ubuntu
releases. Without this hack, this error shows up when linking:

  /usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.1.3/../../../../lib/libf2c.so: undefined reference to `MAIN__'

Note: This taints *all* of libmv and makes it GPL. SBA will be replaced in the
near future with a new bundelr, but that is going to be a substantial amount
of work. In the meantime, libmv will be virally converted to GPL.
