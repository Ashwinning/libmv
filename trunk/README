Building
--------

Before building, make sure you have the following:

* CMake 2.4 or newer.
* Qt4.

Then run 

 $ make

in the toplevel directory. This builds a debug version, and puts it in bin-dbg.
To build an optimized version, do

 $ make release

which puts optimized executables and libraries in bin-dbg/. To run the test
suite, cd in to the appriate directory and run 'make test'

 $ cd bin-dbg
 $ make test

Problems
--------

If you encounter problems running the test suite, please mail the mailing list
or file a ticket on our Google code project page
