README for libmv
=================

Libmv is a full-stack reconstruction system. 

Libmv highlights
================

  * A complete system for reconstruction from videos

	No need to tie together different algorithms from different
	packages to do simple sparse reconstruction; the work's
	already done. It's not perfect, but hopefully it'll get there
	sooner rather than later.

  * An evaluation platform for investigating new algorithms

	Along with a recent Blender (patches included FIXME) it is
	possible to use Blender to generate high-quality rendered
	images from which to evaluate the quality of reconstruction.

A Warning as of January 11th, 2008
==================================

This library is *not ready*! You have been warned!

Building Libmv
==============

Use scons. You'll also need LAPACK, BLAS, and a copy of the boost sources
1.34.x (it doesn't need to be compiled). You also need OpenEXR developent files
and f2c.

Edit the SConscript file to point to the relevant places, then run 

 $ scons

to build everything.

There are no docs yet except for 

http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~keir/masc.pdf

which is a draft of my thesis.

Enjoy,
Keir Mierle
